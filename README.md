### Hi there 👋

I'm a Senior Full Stack Developer with 13+ years building production-grade web applications. I specialize in React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and the fundamentals that power the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My focus is on taking products from 0→1, writing comprehensive test suites with Playwright and Jest, and building robust CI/CD pipelines that actually work. I've shipped greenfield projects with zero critical defects, mentored teams while staying deep in the code, and care about clean architecture, accessibility, and building things that solve real problems.
